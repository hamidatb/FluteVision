# FluteVision 

This is a project I’m building that tries to recognize flute fingerings with computer vision. It uses MediaPipe to track my hands and a Random Forest ML model.

Right now it can pick up a  notes in real time from my webcam. You can record your own samples, train the model, and test it live too.

Still in progress, but it already works.

More features and a better readme coming soon :)
